Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2 ?

HTTP1.1 :
HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol & it is used in client-server communication.HTTP/1.1 which was created in 1997.
It transfer all the requests & responses in the plain text message form.
It is slow than HTTP2.
In HTTP1.1, developers dosen't hava detailed control over prioritization.
HTTP1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it.
HTTP1.1, a server only serves content to a client device if the client asks for it. However, this approach is not always practical for modern webpages, which often involve several dozen separate resources that the client must request.
Small files load more quickly than large ones. To speed up web performance, both HTTP1.1 and HTTP2 compress HTTP messages to make them smaller.

HTTP2 :
 HTTP2 which was created in 2015.
 It works on the binary framing layer instead of textual that converts all the messages in binary format.
 HTTP2 is much faster and more efficient than HTTP1.1. 
 In HTTP2, developers have hands-on, detailed control over prioritization. while using HTTP2 we can decide if the text of a webpage loads first, or the CSS files, or the JavaScript, or whatever they feel is most important for the user experience.
 HTTP2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource .this is called Multiplexing 
 HTTP2 solves this problem by allowing a server to "push" content to a client before the client asks for it. this is called server push.
 HTTP2 uses a more advanced compression method called HPACK that eliminates redundant information in HTTP header packets,resulting in faster loading.
